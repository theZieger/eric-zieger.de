Most of the time, when dealing with vanilla JavaScript code, I try things out directly in the browser. I just open the console within my favorite developer tools and start poking around until I gain whatever I searched for.

Today I made a small mistake and accidentally called something similar to this:

```javascript
myVariable-length
```

And as I hit return on my keyboard, I already saw my foolish mistake. I did no valid property access but performed a calculation with a not defined variable called `length`. Until I saw the output of:


```javascript
myVariable-length
-3
```

What? How did that happen? Did I declare `length` by mistake as a variable? Why does it not throw an error? Or - wait for a second - is this available as a property on the `window` object?

Yep, `window.length` exists. And as I apparently did not know anything about its existence, I asked the best online resource about it - the Mozilla Developer Network web docs.

Yes, it exists. Now you know too.
